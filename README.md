# Trade-off Analyzer

A modern web-based decision-support application that helps users compare technical options by clearly presenting their trade-offs, rather than providing a single prescriptive answer.
 
---
  
## 📌 Overview     

In real-world software engineering, architectural and technology decisions are rarely binary. Each option comes with its own advantages and limitations depending on context, constraints, and priorities. 
  
The **Trade-off Analyzer** is designed to support better decision-making by:
- Structuring comparisons between multiple technical options
- Highlighting strengths and weaknesses in a clear format
- Encouraging informed and context-aware choices  

This project focuses on **decision clarity**, **usability**, and **extensibility**, making it suitable for developers, students, and architects.

--- 

## 🎯 Objectives 

- Promote structured decision-making instead of one-size-fits-all solutions
- Help users understand *why* one option may be better than another in a given context
- Provide a clean and intuitive UI for technical comparisons
- Serve as a foundation for future cloud and system design decision tools

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React.js** – Component-based UI development
- **Vite** – Fast development and build tooling
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first responsive styling
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Application logic and state management
- **Lucide React** – Lightweight and consistent icon system
 
---

## ✨ Key Features

- Side-by-side comparison of technical options
- Structured pros and cons with impact indicators
- Score-based evaluation for quick understanding
- Filter options based on priority and complexity
- Modular and scalable component architecture
- Clean, responsive, and accessible UI

🧠 Use Cases

Comparing API design approaches (e.g., REST vs GraphQL)

Evaluating architectural patterns

Learning system design trade-offs
    
Supporting technical discussions and documentation

Extensible for cloud service comparisons (AWS, etc.)

☁️ Cloud & AWS Relevance

This project aligns closely with the AWS Well-Architected Framework, which emphasizes understanding trade-offs across:

Performance

Cost

Reliability

Operational excellence

Security

The Trade-off Analyzer can be extended to compare AWS services such as:

EC2 vs AWS Lambda

RDS vs DynamoDB

S3 vs EFS

🚧 Future Enhancements

Hosting and deployment using AWS (S3 / Amplify)

AWS service-specific comparison modules

User-defined custom comparisons

Exportable decision reports     

Backend integration for dynamic data
